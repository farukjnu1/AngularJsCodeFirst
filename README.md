🌐 AngularJS + ASP.NET MVC App with Code First ORM

A web application built using AngularJS for dynamic front-end interactivity and ASP.NET MVC for server-side architecture.
This project follows the Code First approach using Entity Framework as the ORM for performing basic data manipulation (CRUD) operations with a SQL Server database.

------------------------

🧭 Overview

This application demonstrates how to integrate AngularJS within an ASP.NET MVC View, enabling seamless AJAX-based communication with the backend.
Using Entity Framework Code First, the project creates and manages the database schema automatically from C# model classes, supporting standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

It’s an excellent reference for developers building interactive web apps using modern JavaScript frameworks with a strong ASP.NET MVC backend.
